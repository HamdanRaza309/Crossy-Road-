# 🐔 Crossy Road (Unity)

A 3D recreation of the classic **Crossy Road** built in **Unity** using C#. The project features procedural terrain generation, infinite gameplay, smooth grid-based movement, dynamic vehicle spawning, collision detection, and a responsive camera system.

This project was developed as an individual **Semester Game Jam Project**.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Crossy Road is an endless arcade game where the player controls a character that must safely cross procedurally generated terrain while avoiding moving traffic. The game combines classic arcade gameplay with procedural generation techniques to create an infinite and replayable experience.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Move using **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**
- Cross roads while avoiding moving vehicles
- Continue progressing forward through an infinite world
- Getting hit by a vehicle ends the game
- Restart and try to beat your previous progress
